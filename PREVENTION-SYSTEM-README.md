# 🛡️ WHISKY WEBSITE PREVENTION SYSTEM

## Overview
This comprehensive prevention system ensures that recurring deployment and operational issues never happen again. It includes automated deployment, monitoring, backup, and testing systems.

## 🎯 What This Prevents

### ❌ Problems We've Solved Forever:
1. **ENCRYPTION_KEY length issues** (31 vs 32 characters)
2. **Missing localhost in CORS configuration**
3. **Deployment breaking existing functionality**
4. **Image/video files disappearing after updates**
5. **Admin login failures after deployment**
6. **Environment variable corruption**
7. **Service configuration drift**
8. **No backup when things go wrong**
9. **No monitoring to catch issues early**
10. **Manual deployment errors**

## 🚀 DEPLOYMENT SYSTEM

### 1. Safe Deployment Pipeline
**File:** `scripts/deployment/safe-deploy.sh`

**Usage:**
```bash
# Safe deployment with full validation
./scripts/deployment/safe-deploy.sh /path/to/deployment.tar.gz
```

**What it does:**
- ✅ Pre-deployment validation
- ✅ Automatic backup creation
- ✅ Staged deployment with rollback capability
- ✅ Critical file preservation
- ✅ Post-deployment testing
- ✅ Automatic issue detection and fixing

### 2. Environment Validation
**File:** `scripts/deployment/validate-env-production.sh`

**Usage:**
```bash
# Run BEFORE every deployment
./scripts/deployment/validate-env-production.sh
```

**Prevents:**
- ENCRYPTION_KEY wrong length
- Missing CORS localhost entries
- Missing required environment variables
- Wrong password hash format

### 3. Auto-Fix Script
**File:** `scripts/deployment/auto-fix-deployment.sh`

**Usage:**
```bash
# Run AFTER every deployment
./scripts/deployment/auto-fix-deployment.sh
```

**Fixes:**
- ENCRYPTION_KEY length automatically
- CORS configuration
- NODE_ENV setting
- Service restart with proper environment

## 📊 MONITORING SYSTEM

### 1. Health Check
**File:** `scripts/monitoring/health-check.sh`

**Usage:**
```bash
# Manual health check
./scripts/monitoring/health-check.sh

# Or use the system command
whisky-health-check
```

**Monitors:**
- Backend service status
- Database connectivity
- Admin login functionality
- Website accessibility
- SSL certificate expiry
- Environment variables
- Resource usage (disk, memory)
- Recent error logs

### 2. Automated Monitoring Setup
**File:** `scripts/monitoring/setup-cron-monitoring.sh`

**Usage:**
```bash
# Run once to set up automated monitoring
sudo ./scripts/monitoring/setup-cron-monitoring.sh
```

**Creates:**
- Daily health checks at 6 AM
- Hourly admin login tests
- Weekly backups at 2 AM Sunday
- Log rotation (30 days retention)
- Status dashboard command

### 3. Monitoring Dashboard
**Command:** `whisky-status`

Shows:
- Active alerts
- Last health check results
- Recent admin issues
- Backend status
- Recent backups

---

## 💾 BACKUP SYSTEM

### 1. Automated Backup
**File:** `scripts/backup/automated-backup.sh`

**Usage:**
```bash
# Create comprehensive backup
./scripts/backup/automated-backup.sh
```

**Backs up:**
- Complete website files
- Database (MongoDB)
- Configuration files (.env, nginx, PM2)
- SSL certificates
- System logs
- Creates manifest for easy restoration

### 2. Quick Restore
**File:** `scripts/backup/quick-restore.sh`

**Usage:**
```bash
# Interactive restore from available backups
./scripts/backup/quick-restore.sh

# Restore specific backup
./scripts/backup/quick-restore.sh 2
```

**Features:**
- Lists available backups
- Safety backup before restore
- Complete system restoration
- Automatic service restart
- Post-restore testing

---

## 🧪 TESTING SYSTEM

### 1. Pre-Deployment Tests
**File:** `scripts/testing/pre-deployment-tests.sh`

**Usage:**
```bash
# Run comprehensive tests before deployment
./scripts/testing/pre-deployment-tests.sh
```

**Tests:**
- Backend service health
- Database connectivity
- Environment configuration
- Admin authentication
- API endpoints
- Frontend files
- Nginx configuration
- SSL certificates
- Website accessibility
- Performance metrics
- Resource usage
- Log analysis

---

## 📋 STEP-BY-STEP PREVENTION WORKFLOW

### For Every Deployment:

1. **BEFORE Deployment:**
   ```bash
   # 1. Run pre-deployment tests
   ./scripts/testing/pre-deployment-tests.sh
   
   # 2. Validate environment
   ./scripts/deployment/validate-env-production.sh
   
   # 3. Create backup
   ./scripts/backup/automated-backup.sh
   ```

2. **DURING Deployment:**
   ```bash
   # Use safe deployment script
   ./scripts/deployment/safe-deploy.sh /path/to/new-deployment.tar.gz
   ```

3. **AFTER Deployment:**
   ```bash
   # Auto-fix runs automatically in safe-deploy.sh
   # But you can run manually if needed:
   ./scripts/deployment/auto-fix-deployment.sh
   
   # Run health check
   whisky-health-check
   
   # Check status dashboard
   whisky-status
   ```

### For Emergency Recovery:

```bash
# Quick restore from latest backup
./scripts/backup/quick-restore.sh

# Or restore from specific backup
./scripts/backup/quick-restore.sh 3
```

---

## 🔧 SYSTEM SETUP

### Initial Setup (Run Once):

1. **Set up monitoring:**
   ```bash
   sudo ./scripts/monitoring/setup-cron-monitoring.sh
   ```

2. **Create first backup:**
   ```bash
   ./scripts/backup/automated-backup.sh
   ```

3. **Test all systems:**
   ```bash
   ./scripts/testing/pre-deployment-tests.sh
   whisky-health-check
   whisky-status
   ```

## 🚨 EMERGENCY PROCEDURES

### If Admin Login Fails:
```bash
# Run auto-fix
./scripts/deployment/auto-fix-deployment.sh

# Check health
whisky-health-check

# If still broken, restore from backup
./scripts/backup/quick-restore.sh
```

### If Website Down:
```bash
# Check status
whisky-status

# Run health check
whisky-health-check

# If critical issues, restore from backup
./scripts/backup/quick-restore.sh
```

### If Deployment Goes Wrong:
```bash
# The safe-deploy.sh script creates automatic backups
# Restore from the pre-deployment backup:
./scripts/backup/quick-restore.sh
```

# Security Fixes Applied - Backend

## Date: 2025-07-21

### Critical Security Issues Fixed

#### 1. **Blog Routes - Admin Authentication Enabled**
- **File**: `/routes/blog.routes.js`
- **Issue**: Admin authentication was commented out, allowing anyone to:
  - Create blog posts (POST /api/blog)
  - Update blog posts (PUT /api/blog/:id)
  - Delete blog posts (DELETE /api/blog/:id)
- **Fix**: Enabled `adminController.verifyAdmin` middleware for all admin routes
- **Risk Level**: CRITICAL - Could allow malicious content injection

#### 2. **Consultation Routes - Admin Authentication Enabled**
- **File**: `/routes/consultation.routes.js`
- **Issue**: Admin authentication was commented out, exposing:
  - Get all consultations (GET /api/consultation)
  - Update consultation status (PATCH /api/consultation/:id)
  - Get upcoming consultations (GET /api/consultation/reminders/upcoming)
- **Fix**: Enabled `adminController.verifyAdmin` middleware for all admin routes
- **Risk Level**: CRITICAL - Exposed sensitive customer data

### Security Best Practices Already Implemented

✅ JWT-based authentication with expiration
✅ Rate limiting on sensitive endpoints:
   - Global: 100 requests/15min
   - Auth routes: 5 requests/15min
   - Contact form: 5 submissions/15min
   - Consultation: 3 bookings/hour
   - Sell whisky: 5 submissions/hour

✅ Input validation using express-validator
✅ Strong password requirements
✅ Protection against:
   - XSS (via Helmet CSP)
   - NoSQL injection (mongoSanitize)
   - Parameter pollution (hpp)
   - HTTPS enforcement
   - CORS with whitelisted origins

### Recommendations for Production

1. **Environment Variables**:
   - Ensure `ADMIN_EMAIL` and `ADMIN_PASSWORD_HASH` are set
   - Use strong `JWT_SECRET` (32+ random characters)
   - Configure proper `ALLOWED_ORIGINS`

2. **Database Security**:
   - Use MongoDB connection with authentication
   - Enable MongoDB access control
   - Use connection string with credentials

3. **Additional Security Measures**:
   - Implement refresh tokens
   - Add audit logging for admin actions
   - Consider implementing 2FA for admin accounts
   - Add API rate limiting per user (not just per IP)
   - Implement API versioning (/api/v1/)

4. **Testing**:
   - Test all admin endpoints require authentication
   - Verify rate limiting works as expected
   - Test input validation on all endpoints

### Running the Backend

For development without MongoDB:
```bash
node simple-server.js
```

For production with MongoDB:
```bash
npm start
```

### Admin Setup

Run the admin setup script to generate secure credentials:
```bash
npm run setup-admin
```

This will generate:
- Secure bcrypt password hash
- JWT secret
- Update .env file with credentials

### Security Checklist for Deployment

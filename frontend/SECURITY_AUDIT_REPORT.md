# Security Audit Report - Whisky Investment Platform Frontend

**Date:** July 21, 2025  
**Auditor:** Security Analysis Tool  
**Scope:** Frontend application security review

## Executive Summary

This security audit identified several critical and high-severity vulnerabilities in the Whisky investment platform frontend that require immediate attention. The most concerning findings include hardcoded credentials, inadequate authentication mechanisms, and potential XSS vulnerabilities.

## Critical Vulnerabilities

### 1. Hardcoded Demo Credentials (CRITICAL)
**Location:** `/src/pages/Admin/Login.tsx` (lines 142-147)  
**Description:** The admin login page displays hardcoded demo credentials in plain text:
- Email: admin@viticult.co.uk
- Password: admin123

**Risk:** These credentials could be active in production, allowing unauthorized admin access.  
**Recommendation:** 
- Remove all hardcoded credentials immediately
- Implement proper demo/sandbox environment if needed
- Use environment-specific configuration

### 2. Weak Authentication Token Storage (HIGH)
**Location:** `/src/pages/Admin/Login.tsx` (line 31), `/src/components/auth/ProtectedRoute.tsx`  
**Description:** Authentication tokens are stored in localStorage, which is vulnerable to XSS attacks.

**Risk:** Tokens can be stolen via XSS, allowing session hijacking.  
**Recommendation:**
- Migrate to httpOnly cookies for token storage
- Implement proper session management with server-side validation
- Add token expiration and refresh mechanisms

### 3. Missing Environment Variable Security (HIGH)
**Location:** `.env`, `.env.production`  
**Description:** 
- `.env` file is tracked in git (should be in .gitignore)
- Production environment file contains placeholder values for sensitive keys
- No validation of environment variable presence

**Risk:** Potential exposure of API keys and sensitive configuration.  
**Recommendation:**
- Add `.env` to `.gitignore` immediately
- Use environment variable validation at startup
- Implement proper secret management for production

## High Severity Vulnerabilities

### 4. Potential XSS Vulnerability (HIGH)
**Location:** `/src/pages/BlogPost.tsx` (line 298)  
**Description:** Use of `dangerouslySetInnerHTML` without apparent sanitization of blog content.

**Risk:** Malicious scripts in blog content could execute in users' browsers.  
**Recommendation:**
- Implement server-side HTML sanitization
- Use DOMPurify on the frontend as an additional layer
- Consider using a markdown renderer instead of raw HTML

### 5. Vulnerable NPM Dependencies (HIGH)
**Description:** NPM audit revealed 11 vulnerabilities:
- 6 High severity vulnerabilities in nth-check, svgo dependencies
- 3 Moderate severity in postcss, webpack-dev-server
- 2 Low severity

**Risk:** Known vulnerabilities could be exploited.  
**Recommendation:**
- Run `npm audit fix` for safe updates
- Review and update react-scripts to latest version
- Implement regular dependency scanning in CI/CD

### 6. Insufficient CORS Configuration (MEDIUM)
**Location:** `/src/services/api.ts`  
**Description:** CORS is disabled (`withCredentials: false`) for most endpoints, but enabled for auth endpoints inconsistently.

**Risk:** Potential for CSRF attacks if not properly configured.  
**Recommendation:**
- Implement consistent CORS policy
- Add proper CSRF token validation
- Configure allowed origins explicitly

## Medium Severity Issues

### 7. Client-Side Input Validation Only (MEDIUM)
**Location:** `/src/services/api.ts`  
**Description:** While the frontend implements good input sanitization with DOMPurify, this should not be the only line of defense.

**Risk:** Malicious users can bypass client-side validation.  
**Recommendation:**
- Ensure server-side validation mirrors client-side rules
- Implement rate limiting on API endpoints
- Add request size limits

### 8. Weak Password Policy (MEDIUM)
**Location:** `/src/pages/Admin/Dashboard.tsx` (line 252)  
**Description:** Password minimum length is only 6 characters with no complexity requirements.

**Risk:** Weak passwords are susceptible to brute force attacks.  
**Recommendation:**
- Implement stronger password requirements (min 12 chars, complexity)
- Add password strength meter
- Consider implementing 2FA for admin accounts

### 9. Missing Security Headers (MEDIUM)
**Description:** No Content Security Policy (CSP) or other security headers configured.

**Risk:** Missing defense against various attacks (XSS, clickjacking, etc.).  
**Recommendation:**
- Implement CSP headers
- Add X-Frame-Options, X-Content-Type-Options
- Configure HSTS for production

## Low Severity Issues

### 10. Information Disclosure (LOW)
**Location:** Error messages throughout the application  
**Description:** Some error messages may reveal internal implementation details.

**Risk:** Information leakage could aid attackers.  
**Recommendation:**
- Implement generic error messages for users
- Log detailed errors server-side only

## Positive Security Findings

1. **Input Sanitization**: Good implementation of DOMPurify for input sanitization
2. **HTTPS Usage**: API URLs use HTTPS in production
3. **Session Storage**: Using sessionStorage instead of localStorage for auth tokens (better than localStorage)
4. **API Security Headers**: Proper security headers added to API requests

## Recommendations Priority

### Immediate Actions (24-48 hours)
1. Remove hardcoded credentials from Login.tsx
2. Add .env to .gitignore
3. Run npm audit fix for dependency vulnerabilities
4. Review and sanitize all blog content rendering

### Short-term (1 week)
1. Migrate authentication to httpOnly cookies
2. Implement proper CORS configuration
3. Add server-side input validation
4. Strengthen password policy

### Medium-term (1 month)
1. Implement CSP and security headers
2. Add 2FA for admin accounts
3. Set up automated security scanning
4. Conduct penetration testing

## Conclusion

The platform shows some good security practices but has critical vulnerabilities that need immediate attention. The hardcoded credentials and weak authentication mechanisms pose the highest risk. Implementing the recommended fixes will significantly improve the security posture of the application.

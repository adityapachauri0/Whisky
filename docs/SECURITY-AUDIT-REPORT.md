# Security Audit Report - Whisky Investment Platform

**Date:** July 21, 2025  
**Auditor:** Security Analysis System  
**Scope:** Full codebase security audit including frontend, backend, configuration, and deployment scripts

## Executive Summary

This security audit has identified several vulnerabilities and security issues across the Whisky investment platform codebase. The findings are categorized by severity level and include recommendations for remediation.

## Critical Severity Issues (Immediate Action Required)

### 1. Exposed Secrets in Environment Files
**Location:** `/backend/.env`, `/backend/.env.production`  
**Issue:** Hardcoded secrets and credentials visible in environment files
- JWT_SECRET is exposed in development environment
- Admin password hash is stored in environment variables
- Email credentials placeholder present
- Weak encryption keys for development

**Impact:** Potential unauthorized access if these files are exposed  
**Recommendation:** 
- Never commit .env files to version control
- Use a secure secret management service (AWS Secrets Manager, HashiCorp Vault)
- Rotate all exposed secrets immediately

### 2. Admin Credentials in Deployment Script
**Location:** `/deploy-to-vps.sh` (lines 112-113)  
**Issue:** Admin credentials exposed in deployment script
```bash
- Email: admin@viticultwhisky.co.uk
- Password: AdminPass2024
```
**Impact:** Direct admin access compromise  
**Recommendation:** Remove credentials from scripts immediately and change admin password

### 3. Weak Development Secrets
**Location:** `/backend/.env`  
**Issue:** Weak development secrets that might be used in production
- `ENCRYPTION_KEY=development-encryption-key-32chars`
- `COOKIE_SECRET=development-cookie-secret`

**Impact:** Predictable encryption keys could lead to data compromise  
**Recommendation:** Generate strong random secrets for all environments

## High Severity Issues

### 4. MongoDB Connection Without Authentication
**Location:** `/backend/server.js` (line 158)  
**Issue:** MongoDB connection string defaults to localhost without authentication
```javascript
mongoose.connect(process.env.MONGODB_URI || 'mongodb://localhost:27017/whisky-investment', {
```
**Impact:** Database exposure if MongoDB is accessible  
**Recommendation:** Always require authentication for MongoDB connections

### 5. Session Secret Configuration
**Location:** `/backend/middleware/session.js` (line 5)  
**Issue:** Weak fallback session secret
```javascript
secret: process.env.SESSION_SECRET || 'dev-session-secret',
```
**Impact:** Session hijacking in production if env variable not set  
**Recommendation:** Fail securely - throw error if SESSION_SECRET not provided

### 6. CSRF Token Storage
**Location:** `/backend/middleware/csrf.js`  
**Issue:** CSRF tokens stored in memory (Map) instead of distributed storage
**Impact:** Tokens lost on server restart, doesn't scale horizontally  
**Recommendation:** Use Redis or similar distributed storage for CSRF tokens

## Medium Severity Issues

### 7. Rate Limiting Configuration
**Location:** `/backend/server.js`  
**Issue:** Rate limits may be too permissive for production
- Global limit: 60 requests per 15 minutes
- Auth limit: 3 failed attempts per 15 minutes

**Impact:** Potential for brute force attacks  
**Recommendation:** Implement progressive delays and IP-based blocking

### 8. Error Information Leakage
**Location:** `/backend/middleware/errorHandler.js`  
**Issue:** Stack traces exposed in development mode
**Impact:** Information disclosure about system internals  
**Recommendation:** Ensure NODE_ENV is properly set to 'production' in production

### 9. Missing Security Headers
**Location:** Frontend responses  
**Issue:** Some security headers missing from frontend:
- Content-Security-Policy not implemented in React app
- Subresource Integrity (SRI) not used for external resources

**Impact:** XSS and injection vulnerabilities  
**Recommendation:** Implement comprehensive CSP and SRI

### 10. Insecure Direct Object References
**Location:** Various API endpoints  
**Issue:** Some endpoints use direct MongoDB ObjectIds without ownership verification
**Impact:** Potential unauthorized data access  
**Recommendation:** Always verify resource ownership before access

## Low Severity Issues

### 11. Console Logging in Production
**Location:** Multiple files  
**Issue:** Console.log statements present that could leak information
**Impact:** Information disclosure  
**Recommendation:** Remove all console.log statements or use proper logging library

### 12. Missing Input Validation
**Location:** Some API endpoints  
**Issue:** Not all inputs are validated consistently
**Impact:** Potential for malformed data  
**Recommendation:** Use validation middleware on all endpoints

### 13. Outdated Dependencies
**Location:** `package.json` files  
**Issue:** Some dependencies may have known vulnerabilities
**Impact:** Various depending on vulnerability  
**Recommendation:** Run `npm audit` and update dependencies

### 14. File Upload Security
**Location:** Backend controllers  
**Issue:** No file upload functionality found, but if added, needs security controls
**Impact:** Potential for malicious file uploads  
**Recommendation:** Implement file type validation, size limits, and virus scanning

## Good Security Practices Observed

1. **HTTPS Enforcement**: Proper HTTPS redirect middleware implemented
2. **Password Hashing**: Using bcrypt with proper salt rounds
3. **JWT Implementation**: Tokens have expiration and proper validation
4. **Input Sanitization**: MongoDB injection protection via express-mongo-sanitize
5. **CORS Configuration**: Properly configured with allowed origins
6. **Helmet.js**: Security headers implemented via Helmet
7. **Rate Limiting**: Basic rate limiting implemented
8. **Session Security**: httpOnly, secure, and sameSite flags set
9. **XSS Protection**: DOMPurify used in frontend for sanitization
10. **SQL Injection**: Not applicable (using MongoDB with sanitization)

## Recommendations Priority List

### Immediate (Within 24 hours)
1. Change admin password and remove from deployment script
2. Rotate all JWT secrets and encryption keys
3. Remove all .env files from version control
4. Update MongoDB connection to require authentication

### Short Term (Within 1 week)
1. Implement proper secret management system
2. Fix CSRF token storage to use Redis
3. Strengthen rate limiting configuration
4. Add comprehensive input validation to all endpoints

### Medium Term (Within 1 month)
1. Implement comprehensive CSP headers
2. Add security monitoring and alerting
3. Perform dependency updates and security patches
4. Implement automated security testing in CI/CD

### Long Term
1. Implement Web Application Firewall (WAF)
2. Add intrusion detection system
3. Regular penetration testing
4. Security awareness training for development team

## Compliance Considerations

Given this is a financial investment platform, consider:
- GDPR compliance for EU users
- Financial services regulations
- Data retention policies
- Audit logging requirements
- KYC/AML implementation

## Conclusion

While the application implements many security best practices, the critical issues identified need immediate attention before production deployment. The exposed credentials and weak secrets pose significant risk. After addressing the critical and high severity issues, the application will have a much stronger security posture suitable for handling financial data and user investments.

**Overall Security Score: 6/10**  
*Score will improve to 8/10 after addressing critical issues*

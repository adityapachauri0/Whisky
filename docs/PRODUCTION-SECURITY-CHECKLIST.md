# üîê Production Security Checklist

## ‚ùå CURRENT STATUS: NOT READY FOR PRODUCTION

The application has critical security issues that MUST be fixed before deployment.

## üö® CRITICAL ISSUES TO FIX IMMEDIATELY

### 1. ‚ùå Exposed Secrets
- [ ] Remove all hardcoded passwords from code
- [ ] Delete `.env` files from repository
- [ ] Generate new strong secrets for production
- [ ] Change admin password (currently exposed as "AdminPass2024")
- [ ] Update all JWT and encryption keys

### 2. ‚ùå Database Security
- [ ] Enable MongoDB authentication
- [ ] Use connection string with credentials
- [ ] Set up database user with minimal permissions
- [ ] Enable SSL/TLS for MongoDB connections

### 3. ‚ùå Secret Management
- [ ] Never commit .env files
- [ ] Use environment variables on VPS
- [ ] Consider using secret management service
- [ ] Rotate secrets every 90 days

## üìã PRE-DEPLOYMENT CHECKLIST

### Environment Setup
- [ ] Generate production secrets using `node scripts/generate-secrets.js`
- [ ] Create `.env.production` from `.env.production.secure` template
- [ ] Set NODE_ENV=production
- [ ] Configure MongoDB with authentication
- [ ] Set up SSL certificates

### Security Headers
- [ ] HTTPS enforced (‚úÖ Already implemented)
- [ ] Helmet.js configured (‚úÖ Already implemented)
- [ ] CORS properly configured (‚úÖ Already implemented)
- [ ] CSP headers set
- [ ] HSTS enabled (‚úÖ Already implemented)

### Authentication & Sessions
- [ ] Strong admin password (min 16 chars)
- [ ] Session secrets are random
- [ ] JWT secrets are strong
- [ ] Cookie security flags set (‚úÖ Already implemented)
- [ ] Rate limiting configured (‚úÖ Already implemented)

### Data Protection
- [ ] Input validation on all endpoints
- [ ] MongoDB injection protection (‚úÖ Already implemented)
- [ ] XSS protection (‚úÖ Already implemented)
- [ ] File upload restrictions
- [ ] Sensitive data encrypted

### Monitoring & Logging
- [ ] Error logging configured
- [ ] Security event monitoring
- [ ] Failed login attempt alerts
- [ ] Resource usage monitoring
- [ ] Backup strategy in place

## üöÄ DEPLOYMENT STEPS

1. **Generate Secrets**
   ```bash
   cd /path/to/whisky
   node scripts/generate-secrets.js
   ```

2. **Create Production Environment**
   ```bash
   cp backend/.env.production.secure backend/.env.production
   # Edit .env.production with generated secrets
   ```

3. **Secure MongoDB**
   ```bash
   # Enable authentication
   # Create database user
   # Update connection string
   ```

4. **Deploy to VPS**
   ```bash
   # Set environment variables on VPS
   # Do NOT include .env files in deployment
   ./deploy-to-vps.sh
   ```

5. **Post-Deployment**
   - [ ] Verify SSL certificate
   - [ ] Test admin login with new password
   - [ ] Check all API endpoints
   - [ ] Monitor logs for errors
   - [ ] Set up automated backups

## ‚ö†Ô∏è SECURITY WARNINGS

1. **NEVER** commit .env files to git
2. **NEVER** use default/weak passwords
3. **ALWAYS** use HTTPS in production
4. **ALWAYS** validate and sanitize input
5. **ALWAYS** keep dependencies updated
6. **REGULARLY** rotate secrets and passwords
7. **MONITOR** for suspicious activities

## üìä Security Score

**Current: 6/10** ‚ùå  
**After fixes: 9/10** ‚úÖ

## üÜò Emergency Procedures

If security breach suspected:
1. Change all passwords immediately
2. Rotate all secrets
3. Review access logs
4. Notify users if data affected
5. Document incident

## üìû Security Contacts

- Security monitoring: [Your monitoring service]
- Incident response: [Your contact]
- DDoS protection: [Your provider]

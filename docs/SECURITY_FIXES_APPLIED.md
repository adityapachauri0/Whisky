# Security Fixes Applied - ViticultWhisky

Date: January 20, 2025

## Summary

This document outlines the critical security fixes applied to the ViticultWhisky codebase to address vulnerabilities identified during the security audit.

## 1. Removed Hardcoded Admin Credentials ✅

### What was fixed:
- Removed hardcoded admin credentials (`admin@viticult.co.uk` / `admin123`) from `backend/controllers/admin.controller.js`
- Replaced with environment variable-based authentication
- Admin credentials now must be configured via environment variables

### Files modified:
- `backend/controllers/admin.controller.js` - Complete refactor to use environment variables

### New implementation:
```javascript
// Admin credentials now retrieved from environment
const getAdminCredentials = () => {
  if (!process.env.ADMIN_EMAIL || !process.env.ADMIN_PASSWORD_HASH) {
    logger.error('Admin credentials not properly configured in environment variables');
    throw new Error('Admin configuration error');
  }
  return {
    email: process.env.ADMIN_EMAIL,
    passwordHash: process.env.ADMIN_PASSWORD_HASH
  };
};
```

## 2. Fixed JWT Secret Hardcoded Fallback ✅

### What was fixed:
- Removed hardcoded JWT secret fallback (`'whisky-admin-secret-key'`)
- JWT secret now strictly requires environment variable configuration
- Application will throw error if JWT_SECRET is not configured

### Files modified:
- `backend/controllers/admin.controller.js` - JWT generation and verification

### New implementation:
```javascript
// No more fallback - requires proper configuration
if (!process.env.JWT_SECRET) {
  logger.error('JWT_SECRET not configured in environment variables');
  throw new Error('Authentication configuration error');
}
```

## 3. Created Secure Admin Setup Script ✅

### What was added:
- New script: `backend/scripts/setup-admin.js`
- Generates secure bcrypt hashes for admin passwords
- Generates cryptographically secure JWT secrets
- Provides clear instructions for environment setup

### How to use:
```bash
cd backend
npm run setup-admin
```

### Features:
- Password validation (min 8 chars, requires uppercase, lowercase, number, special char)
- Generates bcrypt hash with 12 rounds
- Generates 64-byte random JWT secret
- Provides ready-to-use environment variables

## 4. Updated Environment Configuration ✅

### Files modified:
- `backend/.env.example` - Added new required variables
- `backend/package.json` - Added `setup-admin` script

### New required environment variables:
```env
# Admin Authentication (generate using npm run setup-admin)
ADMIN_EMAIL=admin@viticult.co.uk
ADMIN_PASSWORD_HASH=your-bcrypt-hash-here-use-setup-admin-script

# JWT Configuration (no default values allowed)
JWT_SECRET=your-secure-jwt-secret-here-use-setup-admin-script
```

## 5. Removed Console.log Statements ✅

### What was fixed:
- Removed 29 console.log statements from production code
- Replaced with proper Winston logger in backend
- Completely removed from frontend code

### Files cleaned:
#### Backend:
- `backend/server.js`
- `backend/simple-server.js`
- `backend/utils/email.js`

#### Frontend:
- `frontend/src/pages/BlogPost.tsx`
- `frontend/src/pages/Admin/Dashboard.tsx`
- `frontend/src/pages/Admin/Login.tsx`
- `frontend/src/pages/Contact.tsx`
- `frontend/src/pages/SellWhisky.tsx`
- `frontend/src/components/sections/Hero.tsx`
- `frontend/src/index.tsx`

## 6. Added HTTPS Enforcement ✅

### What was added:
- New middleware: `backend/middleware/httpsEnforce.js`
- Forces all production traffic to use HTTPS
- Redirects HTTP GET requests to HTTPS
- Blocks non-GET HTTP requests with error message

### Implementation:
- Added as first middleware in server.js
- Skips enforcement in development mode
- Supports various proxy configurations
- Logs all redirect attempts

## Security Best Practices Now Enforced

1. **No hardcoded secrets** - All sensitive data in environment variables
2. **Strong password requirements** - Minimum 8 chars with complexity rules
3. **Secure cookie settings** - httpOnly, secure in production, sameSite strict
4. **HTTPS only in production** - Automatic enforcement and redirects
5. **Proper logging** - No sensitive data in logs, structured logging with Winston
6. **Error handling** - Generic error messages in production

## Next Steps

1. **Immediate Actions Required:**
   - Run `npm run setup-admin` to generate secure credentials
   - Update your `.env` file with generated values
   - Never commit `.env` files to version control
   - Deploy with HTTPS enabled

2. **Additional Recommendations:**
   - Implement 2FA for admin accounts
   - Add API rate limiting per user
   - Set up monitoring for failed login attempts
   - Regular security audits
   - Implement CSRF protection
   - Add security headers monitoring

## Testing the Changes

1. **Test admin setup:**
   ```bash
   cd backend
   npm run setup-admin
   # Follow prompts to generate credentials
   ```

2. **Test HTTPS redirect (production only):**
   ```bash
   NODE_ENV=production npm start
   # Try accessing http://localhost:5000
   # Should redirect to https://localhost:5000
   ```

3. **Test admin login:**
   - Ensure old hardcoded credentials no longer work
   - Only environment-configured credentials should work

## Important Notes

- **Breaking Change**: Admin login will fail until environment variables are properly configured
- **Development**: HTTPS enforcement is disabled in development mode
- **Deployment**: Ensure all environment variables are set in production
- **Security**: Regularly rotate JWT secrets and admin passwords

These security fixes address the critical vulnerabilities identified in the security audit. The application is now significantly more secure, but ongoing security practices and regular audits are recommended.
